# BASICS!!!
So, this are the basics, this section includes projects using LEDs, Resistors, Push Buttons & Potentiometers.

I loved this section since I was able to understand all about the Arduino Pins (Digital & Analog). I think using a multimeter to measure voltaje & resistance made it more enjoyable. 🤖
